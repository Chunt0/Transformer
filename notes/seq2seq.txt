The seq2seq model is a type of deep learning model used for tasks involving sequence data, where an input sequence is mapped to an output sequence. It is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translatation, text summarization, chatbot development, and more.

The seq2seq model consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder, similar to the archistecture of auto-encoder models. However, in seq2seq models, the encoder and decoder have different roles and functions:

Encoder:
Purpose: The encoder takes an input sequence and encodes it into a fixed-size representation called the "contect vector" or "embedding." The context vector captures the contextual information of the entire input sequence.

Processing: The input sequence is fed into the encoder, which typically consists of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. These RNN layers process the input sequence step-by-step and produce the context vector.

Decoder:

Purpose: The decoder takes the context vector generated by the encoder and uses it to generate the output sequence. The output sequence can have a different length than the input sequence.

Processing: The decoder also consists of RNN layers, which take the context vector as an initial input and generate the output sequence step-by-step. At each time step, the decoder produces the next token in the output sequence based on the context vector and the previously generated tokens.

Training a seq2seq model involves using paired sequences (input and target output) to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the true target output. This is typically done using techniques like teacher forcing, where the decoder is fed with the true target output during training.

Applications of seq2seq models include machine translation (e.g., translating English sentences to French), text summarization (e.g., generating a concise summary of a long article), question-answering systems, and any task that involves mapping an input sequence to an output sequence.

Seq2seq models have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, and their architecture has been extended and adapted for other sequential data problems beyond text, such as speech recognition and time series prediction.

Encoder-decoder models (also called sequence-to-sequence models) use both parts of the Transformer architecture. At each stage, the attention layers of the encoder can access all the words in the initial sentence, whereas the attention layers of the decoder can only access the words positioned before a given word in the input.

The pretraining of these models can be done using the objectives of encoder or decoder models, but usually involves something a bit more complex. For instance, T5 is pretrained by replacing random spans of text (that can contain several words) with a single mask special word, and the objective is then to predict the text that this mask word replaces.

Sequence-to-sequence models are best suited for tasks revolving around generating new sentences depending on a given input, such as summarization, translation, or generative question answering.
